title: Fleshing the site out
date: 2016-08-26

Working with Jekyll is pretty fun. I like the ease of use,
once you get the hang of the formatting and markdown. I've also setup Jekyll
and Github on my machine so I be more efficient. 

I'm learning a lot about source control and revisioning. It's something I've always known about,
but because I didn't write code, I didn't care. As long as the developers were taking care of their end,
I didn't have to worry. We still take backups when we promote code though :)

I hope to flesh this site out more, and jump a little deeper into the WebDev world.
